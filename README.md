Code to Crisis:RakshaX
Team: ResQTech
RakshaX is a disaster management and response system written in C.  
It prioritizes disaster zones using a **Max Heap** priority queue and integrates multiple modules for logging, scheduling, and sensor monitoring. 
The project "Crisis to Care: Rakshax" aims to build a wise disaster management system in C language that prefer aid to the most affected areas using real -time data. 
This population applies maximum stacks for priority on the basis of density, severity, and previous help since last help. 
BFS and modified dijkstra algorithms ensure that rescuers take the safest, fastest route using several transport modes such as trucks, boats and helicopters.
The system balances immediate assistance and fairness in rescue queues and sends timely SMS alerts to the affected areas.
This system improves coordination, reduces delays, and makes disaster response faster and more efficient
